## Background
We will first focus on the DCM PGS, then extend this to BMI-adjusted and BMI-PGS conditional genetic risk in due course.  
 
The idea I have is to estimate the proportion of patients with gene elusive DCM who have disease explained by their DCM PGS. A simple approach would be partition the PGS (above certain level versus remainder) and then declare presence or absence of risk. Ultimately we want to provide an estimator of population attributable risk per individual, using likelihood ratios.

## Datasets

- +/- another DCM case cohort
- UK Biobank for additional population analyses

## Maths

#### Prevalence and Odds

The prevalence of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is given as:

$$
P(D) = \frac{1}{250} = 0.004
$$

The odds of DCM (baseline or pre-test odds) can be calculated as:

$$
\text{Baseline odds} = \frac{P(D)}{1 - P(D)} = \frac{0.004}{1 - 0.004} = \frac{0.004}{0.996} \approx 0.004016
$$

#### Odds Ratio and Post-Test Probability

The odds ratio (OR) per standard deviation (SD) of the polygenic score (PGS) is:

$$
\text{OR} = 1.76 \quad (95\% \, \text{CI: } 1.64 - 1.9)
$$

Using the likelihood ratio (LR) for the 99th percentile of the unaffected population (calculated from ST-4 calculator)@adPerformancePolygenicRisk2023:

$$
\text{LR}^+ = 3.18
$$

The post-test odds for DCM are calculated as:

$$
\text{Post-test odds} = \text{Baseline odds} \times \text{LR}^+
$$

$$
\text{Post-test odds} = 0.004016 \times 3.18 \approx 0.01278
$$

Convert the post-test odds to post-test probability:

$$
\text{Post-test probability} = \frac{\text{Post-test odds}}{1 + \text{Post-test odds}}
$$

$$
\text{Post-test probability} = \frac{0.01278}{1 + 0.01278} \approx 0.01262
$$

#### Attributable Fraction Among the Exposed (AFE)

The attributable fraction among the exposed (AFE) is calculated as:

$$
\text{AFE} = 1 - \frac{\text{Risk in unexposed}}{\text{Risk in exposed}}
$$

Where:  
- Risk in unexposed = baseline probability \(P(D) = 0.004\)  
- Risk in exposed = post-test probability \(P(D \mid \text{exposed}) = 0.01262\)

$$
\text{AFE} = 1 - \frac{0.004}{0.01262}
$$

$$
\text{AFE} = 1 - 0.3169 \approx 0.6831
$$

Thus, the attributable fraction among the exposed is approximately:

$$
\text{AFE} \approx 68.3\%
$$
